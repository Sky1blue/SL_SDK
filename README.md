# SL_SDK

## Introduction

SL_SDK is the software development kit for embedded devices, such as Cortex-M based MCU or RISC-V MCU. It provides varies of platform-related and cross-platform code to speed-up the development.

Till now, the SL_SDK is consist of following modules:

* RTE: Provides dynamic memory pool, concurrent data structure, log system and shell system.

* HAL: Provides united hardware devices instantiate and access api.

* OSAL: Provides united OS api to make cross-platform easier.

* SIS: Like CMSIS, try to provide united API to adapt different core like Cortex-M or RISC-V.
